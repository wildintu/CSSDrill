            <h2>VSCO Girls Take Over The World</h2>
            <p>What started as a small <span class="movement">movement</span> is now a the new norm! Mass production of Hydroflasks are necessary to keep up with the demand amongst the VSCO girl community. Businesses have slowly adopted the idea of not offering straws since VSCO girls carry their own reusable metal straws. Turtles are now the icon or mascot of 90% of businesses all over the world to appeal to this VSCO generation. Many of those who have opposed this movement are now slain or taken as slaves where they create and produce scrunchies on a daily basis.</p>

            <h2>The History Behind Yeet</h2>
            <p>Originating in the mid-2000s, <span class="YEET">YEET</span> took the world by storm. Not only was it fun to say, it allowed individuals to truly express their excitment in a way no other word has allowed. Today it is one of the most often used words in society.</p>

            <h2>Stop, Drop, & Roll Kids</h2>
            <p>Last year, <span class="ignited">ignited</span> accelerator fluid got splashed onto my knee and caused my knee to catch on fire. Out of reaction I tried to put it out with my hand, but instead the fire spread to my hand. In panic, I froze. A friend of mine tackled me to the ground which ultimately put the fire out.</p>

            <h2>Are Yordles The Best?</h2>
            <p>In the game of <span class="League">League</span>, many have come to find love for their champ. It can be argued who is the best or worst, but in my honest opinion - Yordles are the best! Not only are they cute and tiny in stature, but they also can deal a great amount of damage to any opponent. Often understimated in battle, many enemies soon realize that they have a much bigger challenge ahead of them.</p>
